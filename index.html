						<p>
							The ocean has always been present in my earliest childhood memories. I grew up by the sea, where my grandfather immersed me in the underwater world, for which I ended up making my career. However, after a few decades, some of those memories belong to an underwater landscape that would be unrecognizable to that child. Since then, the decline of marine ecosystems has pushed me to develop a great interest in matters related to the Ocean-Human interface. As a result, I have passionately immersed myself in what I was doing, first at an obvious choice in my academics and later at a professional level.

					<p>
						In 2014, I graduated from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria with a B.S. in Marine Science. Delving into the scientific knowledge associated with my undergraduate studies encouraged me to pursue a career in marine science and environmental management. At my first job at the Spanish Bank of Algae—a research center associated with my university—I focused on algae biodiversity. There, I participated in environmental management initiatives such as the MIMAR project working with harmful algal blooms (HABs), a cooperation program in Algeria, and a research stay at the Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Institute of Haifa.
						<p>
						After that, I applied my expertise in consulting firms, such as ECOS, where I worked on monitoring seagrass ecosystems and water quality assessments. Later, I got involved in further marine management projects with TRAGSATEC, specifically participating in environmental impact assessments, endangered species recovery programs, the monitoring of aquaculture facilities, the management of marine protected areas (MPAs), and the development of new ones in the Canary Archipelago.
						<p>
						My enthusiasm for environmental science and management issues is closely tied to my passion for data science. In 2020, I decided to further pursue my interest in data science by enrolling in a Master's in Biostatistics at the University of Barcelona. This academic experience enhanced my programming abilities and knowledge in statistics, multivariate analysis, and modeling.
						<p>
						Recently, I completed my Master's in Environmental Science and Management at UCSB, where I was able to improve my understanding of environmental issues while further delving into Data Science. While at UCSB, I balanced my program with additional data science courses, allowing me to consolidate my existing skills in R and improve my ability to code in SQL and Python while enhancing my expertise in working with environmental datasets, data visualization, geospatial analysis, and machine learning.
						<p>
						As a recent graduate, I envision myself working on environmental management issues from a data science perspective. I plan to use my data analysis skills and knowledge in environmental science and management to contribute to the field so that more informed decisions about environmental impacts can be made. I am passionate about developing new methods for monitoring and predicting the effects of human activity on the environment. I firmly believe that by using data to understand and address environmental issues, we can make more effective decisions about protecting our planet.
